        A tall vertical panel. Horizontal metal bands fill the upper section, rusted and riveted, with vertical lines of small nail heads descending through them. Four white porcelain insulators step down from the metal into the textured field below.

        The lower field is sand and fine gravel in gray-blue. A seam of lighter aggregate runs down the center like a crack or a path.

        The insulators are salvaged from an old house - they carry history. Porcelain knobs screwed into wood framing, keeping electrical wire safely away from the structure. Every old house had them before modern wiring. Functional objects, now obsolete, salvaged and placed here where they punctuate the transition from metal to earth.
