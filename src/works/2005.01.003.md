        Two textured vertical strips flank a central panel of warm ochre wood. Madrone branches extend horizontally from both sides at top - reaching outward like arms or antlers. A rock sits at the top center. A found piece of rust runs vertically down the central panel, irregular and organic.

        This totem has gesture. Where the quiet one stood still, this one opens itself. The branches break the frame, reaching into the space around it.
