        Three vertical panels share a single image: a boat hull sketched in pine sticks and wire, floating on a diagonal across an ochre field. A dark red band runs behind the skeletal form like water or shadow.

        The hull is open, permeable - ribs without planking. The sticks are bound at their intersections, creating a structure that holds its shape while remaining transparent. It spans the gaps between panels as if the vessel exists independent of its support.

        Small fabric squares mark the upper portion of each panel. Cross-shaped forms punctuate the lower edge. Gold rectangles provide accent. But the eye follows the diagonal, follows the ghost of a boat moving across the composition.

        This piece shares vocabulary with the [Boats triptych](/works/boats/) - the same interest in vessel forms reduced to skeleton, the same use of sticks and binding to suggest what remains after the solid structure is gone.
