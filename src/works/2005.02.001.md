  description: 'A totemic form. Rectangular base in gray sand texture, split by a central blue column with horizontal red bands. Rising above, a deep red crescent - curved like horns, like a moon, like something ceremonial.'

        A tall narrow panel. Red cap at top. Dark fields above and below - textured with drywall mesh tape, the kind used to join sheetrock panels. The grid pattern shows through the dark paint. A horizontal band of sand crosses the center.

        At the center sits a small wire composition - rusted fence wire and electrical circuit wire formed into a compact shape. It reads as organic, like a dried flower or seed pod, but it's entirely constructed.

        Nothing natural here. Red paint, drywall tape, sand, wire - all materials from construction, from human making. Even the thing that appears to have grown was built.
