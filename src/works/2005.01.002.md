        A rectangular base - gray sand texture flanking a central blue column marked with horizontal red bands. A wooden post extends upward from the column, supporting a deep red crescent that curves like horns or a rising moon.

        The piece is vertical, symmetrical, frontal. It occupies space the way a figure does. The crescent crowns the form, giving it presence.

        I didn't know what to call these wall sculptures. A friend looked at them and said they look like totems. The name stuck.
