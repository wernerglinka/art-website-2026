  description: 'This piece came from a night in the Montana mountains during a thunderstorm. The rumbles and rolls of thunder, the cracks, the flashes hitting the earth - impossible to describe with words. This captures such a night.'

        Black, red, gold - the colors of the German flag, rearranged as geometric blocks rather than stripes. Red across the top. Two black rectangles below, flanking a central yellow column.

        A rusty wire traces a path down the surface, supported by small wood branch segments standing a few inches high. The elevation lifts the wire off the color plane, creating space for light to pass beneath. Shadows fall on red, on yellow - shifting through the day, never fixed.

        The colors of my past. Gelsenkirchen, the Ruhr Valley, the place I came from. These will always have a place. The wire wanders across them, suspended, casting shadows the way memory casts itself across what was.
