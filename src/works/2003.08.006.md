  description: 'This piece came from a night in the Montana mountains during a thunderstorm. The rumbles and rolls of thunder, the cracks, the flashes hitting the earth - impossible to describe with words. This captures such a night.'

        Two vertical panels. The upper third of each constructs fragmented American flag imagery from newspaper clippings and rusted metal banding. Stars cut from newsprint. Stripes made from industrial slats, riveted in place.

        The headlines are legible: WAR. IRAQ. Threatens peace. Nation & World.

        The metal bands that appear throughout my work usually reference construction sites, industrial cast-offs. Here they become American industrial strength - the machine that makes war possible.

        Below, ash dominates both panels. The result of war. What remains.
