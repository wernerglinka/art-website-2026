        Four panels, four windows. Earth alternates with red. Vertical rectangles alternate with squares.

        Each window frames a single found object - a forked branch, a spotted madrone leaf, an oak leaf, another branch. Nothing more. The object sits in its opening, isolated, presented.

        The branches rest in hollows cut into the panel. Their surfaces carry traces of wood-boring insects - meandering channels carved between bark and core. Paths left by small lives, now part of the object.

        Where the field is earth-textured, the window reveals red. Where the field is red, the window holds sand. The reversal repeats across all four panels - ground becomes frame, frame becomes ground.

        One leaf. One branch. Ordinary things, given a stage.
