        Metal banding arrives at construction sites wrapped tight around lumber and concrete blocks, doing invisible work. Once cut, it's discarded - tossed in dumpsters, left to rust in piles. I collect these cast-off strips and give them new purpose.

        This piece builds a circular form from interlocking bands, each bent at angles and woven through its neighbors. The structure holds itself together through tension and connection - no element exists in isolation. Brass wire binds the joints, but the real stability comes from how the parts interlock.

        The metal carries its history. Some strips retain warm copper and bronze tones; others have oxidized to cooler steel-grey. Time and weather have painted each piece differently. I don't fight this - the patina variation becomes part of the composition, creating a color rhythm that moves around the form.

      prose: Light matters here. The raised structure casts shadows onto the dark ground behind it, so the piece exists twice - once as physical object, once as shadow. Depending on how it's lit, the character shifts. The void at the center anchors the composition, a stillness surrounded by the complexity of interwoven metal.

        This piece is part of a series - Change of Context - refers to what happens when discarded materials are removed from their original function. The banding no longer secures anything. It has become something else.
