        Black sky above, deep red earth below. At the horizon where they meet, pine sticks fan outward in a symmetrical V, suggesting wings in flight. Among the sticks, silvery money plant seed pods cluster and trail downward.

        The form is unmistakable - a bird, an angel, something ascending or descending at the boundary between two worlds. The sticks radiate with the precision of feathers; the translucent seed pods add points of light along the wingspan.

        The painted surfaces are textured, worked. The black carries subtle variations; the red has depth built through layers. But the eye goes to the center, to that moment of lift where natural materials break free of the painted ground.
