        Princeton Harbor sits along the San Mateo coast, a working harbor where fishing boats come and go. I spent years walking those docks - past boats being repaired, boats waiting for parts, boats that would never see water again. The hulls of abandoned vessels fascinated me. Stripped of planking, their ribs exposed, they became something other than boats. They were carcasses, skeletons, the memory of a form.

        This triptych explores that transformation. Each panel holds the same pointed hull shape - the essential silhouette that says "vessel" - but constructed from different materials that suggest different stages or states of being.

        The first form is built from wood dowels and metal banding - the steel strapping used to secure construction materials. Industrial fastening repurposed into structure. The bands wrap and bind, holding the mass together.

      prose: The second is pine, split by hand with an axe and painted black. The rough-hewn surfaces catch light unevenly. The split grain gives each piece its own character while the black unifies them into a single dark form, almost like charred remains.

      prose: The third opens up. Pine sticks bound with old rusty fence wire, the kind that sags between posts in forgotten pastures. It's the most skeletal of the three, permeable to light and air. What remains when the solid hull has fallen away.

        The first panel is now part of the permanent collection at the Peninsula Museum of Art in San Mateo.
