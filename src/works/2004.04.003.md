        A weathered branch breaks the frame, extending beyond the painted rectangle. Below it, a grid of aluminum rivets punctuates a field of layered blue - scratched, brushed, built up. At the bottom edge, a rust-red rectangle anchors the composition.

        The piece started with the grid. Something was missing. The branch arrived and changed everything - organic form against industrial pattern, irregular against ordered. The tension was discovered, not planned.
