        Three horizontal panels in deep teal and blue-green, each divided into color fields. A small forked branch crosses each panel at a different position - upper right, upper left, lower right - moving through the composition like something glimpsed and then gone.

        The color is night sky in the mountains. The bottom panel carries golden marks worked into the surface - distant flashes, light on clouds. The branches could be trees against the sky, or the lightning itself.

        This piece came from a night in the Montana mountains during a thunderstorm. The rumbles and rolls of thunder, the cracks, the flashes hitting the earth - impossible to describe with words. This captures such a night.
