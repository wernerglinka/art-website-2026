        Three horizontal zones divide the panel. At top, dark brown paint with visible brushstrokes holds a patch of pale green lichen - a small eruption of texture against the flat field. Below, translucent money plant seed pods overlap in layers, their silvery membranes catching light against hints of coral beneath. At bottom, sand mixed into the surface creates an earthen band.

        A branch crosses horizontally at the first division. Another extends diagonally through the lower portion, breaking the strict geometry.

        Money plant seed pods - Lunaria annua - are distinctive. After the flowers fade, these papery, coin-like discs remain. They're almost transparent, each one slightly different. Gathered and layered here, they create a luminous middle zone between earth below and darkness above.
