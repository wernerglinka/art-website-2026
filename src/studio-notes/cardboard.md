        Cardboard arrives flat. Boxes torn apart, stacked on the workbench. Packaging. The thing you break down for recycling.

        Cut it. Stack it. Glue it. Now it has depth. The corrugated edges - hidden when the box was a box - become visible. Each layer adds a line. The lines accumulate into texture.

        Paint it, or don't. The structure remains. What was disposable is now volume.
