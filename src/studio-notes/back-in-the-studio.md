        Ten years away. A new city, a new studio at the [Center for People and Craft](https://www.peopleandcraft.org/) in Minneapolis. Time to start again.

        The work on this website initially spans from 2001 to 2008 - metal banding, rusted wire, salvaged wood, found objects from construction sites and forest walks. That vocabulary isn't going anywhere. But I'm also exploring new materials now.

        Cardboard. Paper mache. Who knows what I find next. Materials people throw away without a second look.

        When I mention cardboard, I get puzzled responses. What can a serious artist do with cardboard? I understand the skepticism. We see cardboard as packaging, as the thing we break down for recycling. Disposable.

        But look at it differently. Stacked and cut, cardboard creates volume - layered edges that catch light and shadow. The corrugated cross-section has rhythm. The surface takes paint, or doesn't need it at all. It's humble, available, and carries the same potential for transformation as any other cast-off material.

        The rusted fence wire in my earlier work was once just fencing. The metal banding was strapping around lumber. The material doesn't arrive as art. It becomes art when you see what it can do.

        I'll be posting notes here as the work develops. Process shots, material experiments, questions I'm working through. Not finished pieces - those will come. This is the in-between.
