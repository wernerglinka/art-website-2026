        After ten years away from making art, I wasn't looking for a studio. I was looking for community. The Center for People and Craft found me.

        It's an emerging folk school in Minneapolis, tucked into a stone building next to St. Mark's Cathedral in Loring Park.

        ![](/assets/images/studio-notes/cpc-building.jpg)

        The model comes from Denmark - 19th century folk schools that brought people together around shared craft, tradition, and learning. Not credentials. Not degrees. Just hands working alongside other hands.

        The programming reflects this. Willow basketry. Couching embroidery. Kolrosing. Two-at-a-time sock knitting. Traditional crafts and their contemporary expressions. People show up to learn something with their hands, and in the process they connect - to technique, to heritage, to each other.

        I walked in and felt the energy of a place being built. Volunteers painting walls, building worktables, planning workshops. Nothing polished, everything possible. The kind of place where you want to contribute.

        Now I have a studio here. I'm making assemblages again - working with cardboard and paper mache alongside the rusty wire and found materials I've always used. The folk school context fits. This is hand work. This is transforming ordinary materials into something worth attention.

        If you're in Minneapolis, [visit us](https://www.peopleandcraft.org/). We're building something good.
